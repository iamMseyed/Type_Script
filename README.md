2. **Install TypeScript:** Once Node.js is installed, you can install TypeScript globally using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g typescript
    ```

3. **Clone this repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```

4. **Navigate to the project directory:** Move into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd type_script
    ```
